15. 3Sum

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find 
all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],
A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]

Solution: 
Step 1: Sort the array (nlogn)
Step 2: Now in n^2 we can find all combinations for nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = 0
Step 3: To optimize for nums[i], while nums[i] = nums[i+1], do i += 1
Step 4: Similary for j and k,
            while nums[j] = nums[j+1], do j += 1
            while nums[k] = nums[k-1], k -= 1
