888. Fair Candy Swap

Alice and Bob have candy bars of different sizes: A[i] is the size of the i-th 
bar of candy that Alice has, and B[j] is the size of the j-th bar of candy that 
Bob has.

Since they are friends, they would like to exchange one candy bar each so that 
after the exchange, they both have the same total amount of candy.  (The total 
amount of candy a person has is the sum of the sizes of candy bars they have.)

Return an integer array ans where ans[0] is the size of the candy bar that Alice 
must exchange, and ans[1] is the size of the candy bar that Bob must exchange.

If there are multiple answers, you may return any one of them.  It is guaranteed 
an answer exists.
 
Example 1:
Input: A = [1,1], B = [2,2]
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:
Input: A = [1,2], B = [2,3]
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: A = [2], B = [1,3]
Output: [2,3]

Example 4:
Input: A = [1,2,5], B = [2,4]
Output: [5,4]
 
Note:
1 <= A.length <= 10000
1 <= B.length <= 10000
1 <= A[i] <= 100000
1 <= B[i] <= 100000
It is guaranteed that Alice and Bob have different total amounts of candy.
It is guaranteed there exists an answer.

ALGORITHM:
1. If Alice swaps candy x, she expects some specific quantity of candy y back.
2. Say Alice and Bob have total candy a_sum, bsum respectively.
3. If Alice gives candy x, and receives candy y, then Bob receives candy x and 
   gives candy y. Then, we must have
â€‹	     asum - ax + bx = bsum - bx + ax
        2ax - 2bx = asum - bsum
        ax - bx = (asum - bsum)/2 
4. Find elements ax from A and bx from B, such that ax - bx = (asum - bsum)/2

RUNTIME COMPLEXITY: O(A.length+B.length).
SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(B.length), the space used by setB.
